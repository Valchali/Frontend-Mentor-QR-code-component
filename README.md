'''html
<img src="/images/image-qr-code.png" width="300px" height="300px">
'''

'''css
body{
  background-color: rgb(214, 214, 252);
  display: flex;
align-items: center;
justify-content: center;
height: 100vh;
}
'''
'''css
.container{
background-color: white;
border: 1px solid light gray;
border-radius: 10px;
display: flex;
flex-direction: column;
